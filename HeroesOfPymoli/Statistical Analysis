Statistical Analysis

  The first thing I noticed from the data is that an overwhelming amount of users are male. 
While this not a surprise in the video game industry, it is interesting to take look at the 
data associated with gender. For example, over 84% of users are male and those users account
for 82.7 percent of all purchases. That piece of information may help video game makers/
marketers design or distribute the game differently. For example, ads for these games can be 
displayed during shows or YouTube videos with predominately male audiences.  

  The second thing I noticed was the data associated with the age ranges of users. 
Users that are 15 to 29 years old account for 76.7 percent of all users. Again, this is not
surprising, but this information can be used to target other people in those age ranges, because 
they are more likely to buy and play this game than the rest of the general public. 

  Lastly, the age range (15 to 29 year olds) alluded to above are the biggest spenders compared to
the other age ranges. These age ranges account for over 68% of all purchases. The 20-24 year 
old range dominates that age group with nearly triple the amount of purchases than any other group.
They also are responsible for the 3rd highest average purchase price, suggesting that they are among
the least frugilegroup with the spending habbits. 

  All of the statistical analysis above will help both video game makers and distributor have a better
understanding of their user demographic, which play a major role in designing, distributing and
marketing the games going forward. If they want to continue focusing on male users, they can add 
elements to the games that will bring them back. On the other hand, if they want more women to 
purchase their games, they will change of the elements that will get women more into the game.
Whichever way they decide to go, this data serves a major role.
