# pandas-challenge

This repo contains my Jupyter Notebook file along with the csv file that goes with it. When I wrote the code in Jupyter notebook, everything looked great, but for some reason when I uploaded it to github there seems to be an error in some of the tables. I have attached screenshots of my code in Jupyter Notebook to show you how it looked before I uploaded it in here. Additionally, there is an Analysis file.
